# Scala ETL
Scala is exceptionally good at distributed ETL.  Aside from this use case, currently cannot think of using it regularly.  Therefore, I figured a collection of Scala snippets that are designed for ETL as they are needed would be helpful for code reuse in the future, and might help speed up development of efficient ETL pipelines in the future.
